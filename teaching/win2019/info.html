			<h4> Instructor: AMOS TURCHET</h4> <br>
			
			<h4> Webpage: <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~aturchet/teaching/win2019/math340.html">https://sites.math.washington.edu/~aturchet/teaching/win2019/math340.html</a> </h4><br>
			
			<h4> Course Mailing-List: <em>math340a_wi19@uw.edu</em></h4><br>
			
			<h4> Homeworks:</h4>
				
  		<ul> <li> Homework assignments will be collected at the beginning of class the day it is due. </li>
			 <li> The homework will be posted on the course website at least a week ahead of time.</li>
			 <li> You may discuss the homework with your classmates, however the assignment must be written up on your own, and for each problem, you must list the names of everyone with whom you worked.</li>
			 <li> Homeworks SHOULD be stapled and your name should appear clearly on the first page. </li>
			 <li> Homework assignments will be worth 40/50 points each. Between 4 and 5 of the assigned problems will be graded; the possible scores on each are 0,1,5,9, or 10. Sometimes the remaining 10 points will be allocated based on the completeness of the remaining problems. </li>
			 <li> The lowest homework score will be dropped.</li><br>
			 
			 <li> Make sure that the length of your answer is reasonable (it is NOT OK to have 4 pages of solutions when it could be done in 1 line). </li>
			 <li> Use sentences NOT (sequence of) symbols. Moreover some symbols are NOT standard (I suggest you stick with only "for all" \(\forall\) and "exists" \(\exists\) symbols within the logic symbols).</li>
			 <li> Do not use adverbs like "obviously" or "clearly": it is obvious use 1 sentence to say why, if it is not you have to explain it. </li>
			 <li> Make sure to solve EVERY part of a problem (recall that the exercises are taken from the 4th edition of the book).</li>
			 <li> Some exercises are supposed to be harder than others, but they introduce concepts that are both useful and might be used in other parts of the course.</li>
			 	 
		  </ul><br>
		  
		  	<h4> Prerequisites:</h4>
		
		<ul> <li> Math 340 assumes that you took Math 308 and Math 300 previously. </li>
			<li> <a href="340/prereq.pdf">HERE</a> you can find a quick and non-inclusive list of concepts from math 300 that we might use (do not worry if you didn't cover all the parts of the documents - in particular we might not talk about relations in this course).</li>
			<li> <a href="340/308_prerequisites.pdf">HERE</a> you can find a very general list of concepts and abilities that are covered in Math 308. We will review most of this in class but we will do it rather quickly. So I suggest you use the book and the exercise to review and/or familiarize yourself with the parts of Math 308 that you don't remember well.</li></ul><br>
			
			<h4> Office Hours: </h4> You are strongly invited to consider taking advantage of Office Hours. They are designed to answer any questions you have and to help you better understand the content of the course. Even if you aren’t confused, come to office hours we can talk about something else or you can help clarify things for another student. Nothing solidifies your understanding as well as explaining it to someone else does. <br><br>

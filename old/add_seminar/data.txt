1|Marco Maculan|Jussieu - Paris 6|GIT and Diophantine Approximation|During August and September 2015, Marco Maculan (Institut Mathématiques de Jussieu - Paris VI) will give a series of lectures on Geometric Invariant Theory and Diophantine Approximation.\n The lectures will begin with a basic introduction to Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) - a theory developed by Mumford in the '60s to construct moduli spaces - and then will expound a proof of Roth's Theorem - a classical result in Diophantine Approximation - based on techniques of GIT|To know more about program and schedule click <a href="marco.html">HERE</a>|Aug 24 - Sept 4 2015||
2|Julia Brandes|Chalmers|Counting rational points on complete intersections via the Hardy-Littlewood circle method|Let \(F\) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree \(d\) in \(s\) variables, then heuristic arguments show that the variety defined by \(F=0\) should contain roughly \(P^{s-d}\) points. It has been proved by Birch in 1961 that this heuristic holds true, provided there are no local obstructions, whenever the number of variables is large enough compared to the singular locus of the variety. His methods are mainly Fourier-analytic and in their essence go back to Hardy, Ramanujan and Littlewood. I will give an sketch of his proof and, time permitting, highlight some of the more recent developments in the area||Oct 13 2015|MV:L14, Chalmers tvärgata. Starts at 10:00 AM|
3|Martin Westerholt-Raum (Chalmers)|Differential Operators for Siegel Modular Forms|The theory of modular forms receives many of it interesting features by virtue of Hecke operators. Hecke operators are essentially transformations of the functions by composition with simple biholomorphic mappings. Despite their simplicity, the impact they have on arithmetic features of modular forms is enormous. According to a general philosophy, Hecke operators are complemented by differential operators, which should play an analogous role. In this talk, we explain how differential operators yield new types of modular forms, and how those appear in applications. In basic cases the description of these new modular forms in terms of classical ones is known. We extend this description to more cases, that relate to topological string theory||Oct 27th|MV:H11, Chalmers tvärgata. Starts at 10:15 AM|
4|Per Salberger|Chalmers|Counting rational points on cubic curves|We present a new uniform bound for the number of rational points of height at most B on non-singular cubic curves, which improves upon a bound of Heath-Brown and Testa.||Nov 12th|MV:L14, Chalmers tvärgata. Starts at 10:00 AM|
5|Gerard Freixas i Montplet|CNRS, Paris Jussieu|An introduction to Arakelov geometry|During November 2015, Gerard Freixas (CNRS, Institut Mathématiques de Jussieu - Paris VI) will give a series of lectures on Arakelov Geometry.\n The lectures will begin with a basic introduction to Arakelov geometry and will then focus on applications to arithmetic surfaces|To know more about program and schedule click <a href="gerard.html">HERE</a>|Nov 17th - 26th||

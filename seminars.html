                     GIT and Diophantine Approximation
                    <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>During August and September 2015, Marco Maculan (Institut Mathématiques de Jussieu - Paris VI) will give a series of lectures on Geometric Invariant Theory and Diophantine Approximation.
The lectures will begin with a basic introduction to Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) - a theory developed by Mumford in the '60s to construct moduli spaces - and then will expound a proof of Roth's Theorem - a classical result in Diophantine Approximation - based on techniques of GIT.</h6> <h5>To know more about program and schedule click <a href="marco.html">HERE</a></h5>

                    Counting rational points on complete intersections via the Hardy-Littlewood circle method
                   <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>Let \(F\) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree \(d\) in \(s\) variables, then heuristic arguments show that the variety defined by \(F=0\) should contain roughly \(P^{s-d}\) points. It has been proved by Birch in 1961 that this heuristic holds true, provided there are no local obstructions, whenever the number of variables is large enough compared to the singular locus of the variety. His methods are mainly Fourier-analytic and in their essence go back to Hardy, Ramanujan and Littlewood. I will give an sketch of his proof and, time permitting, highlight some of the more recent developments in the area.</h6>

                Differential Operators for Siegel Modular Forms
               <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>The theory of modular forms receives many of it interesting features by virtue of Hecke operators. Hecke operators are essentially transformations of the functions by composition with simple biholomorphic mappings. Despite their simplicity, the impact they have on arithmetic features of modular forms is enormous. According to a general philosophy, Hecke operators are complemented by differential operators, which should play an analogous role. In this talk, we explain how differential operators yield new types of modular forms, and how those appear in applications. In basic cases the description of these new modular forms in terms of classical ones is known. We extend this description to more cases, that relate to topological string theory.</h6>

               Around Hilbert Irreducibility Theorem
              <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>The celebrated Hilbert Irreducibility Theorem states that given  an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients, there exist infinitely many specializations of one variables giving rise to an irreducible polynomial of the second variable. In geometric terms, it can be rephrased by saying that given a (possibly reducible) algebraic curve \(\mathcal{C}\) and a morphism \(\mathcal{C}\to \mathbb{A}^1\), admitting no rational sections, the image of the rational  points of \(\mathcal{C}\) cannot cover the rational points of the line. An analogue statement holds with any rational varieties in place of the line. We address the problem of understanding which algebraic varieties share this property with the rational ones.</h6>

               Probabilistic Galois Theory and Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem.
              <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>Our plan in this series of three talks is first to review some tools on bounding the number of integer points on curves, such as the large sieve and results by Bombieri-Pila and Browning-Heath-Brown, and then discuss applications to questions from "Probabilistic Galois Theory": What upper bounds can one give for the number of monic integer polynomials of given degree and bounded height having a given Galois group? As it turns out, the probability for a "random" polynomial to have full symmetric Galois group is one. More generally, one can ask the same question for Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem: If \(f(X, t)\) is an irreducible integer polynomial, then for almost all specializations of \(t\) one obtains an irreducible polynomial \(f(X)\). What quantitative bounds can one obtain for the number of "exceptional" \(t\)?</h6>

               Cohomological stabilization of toroidal compactifications of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties.
              <h5>Abstract:</h5><h6>It is well known that the cohomology of the moduli space \(\mathcal{A}_g\) of \(g\)-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties stabilizes when the degree is smaller than \(g\). This is a classical result of Borel on the stable cohomology of the symplectic group. By work of Charney and Lee, also the stable cohomology of the minimal compactification of \(\mathcal{A}_g\), the Satake compactification, is explicitly known. In this talk, we consider the stable cohomology of toroidal compactifications of \(\mathcal{A}_g\), concentrating on the perfect cone compactification and the matroidal partial compactification. We prove stability results for these compactifications show that all stable cohomology is algebraic. We also obtain results on the structure of stable cohomology.
This is joint work with S. Grushevsky and K. Hulk.</h6>

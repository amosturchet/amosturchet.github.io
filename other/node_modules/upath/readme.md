# upath v1.1.2

A drop-in replacement / proxy to nodejs's `path` that:

  * Replaces the windows `\` with the unix `/` in all string params & results. This has significant positives - see below.

  * Adds **filename extensions** functions `addExt`, `trimExt`, `removeExt`, `changeExt`, and `defaultExt`.

  * Add a `normalizeSafe` function to preserve any meaningful leading `./` & a `normalizeTrim` which additionally trims any useless ending `/`.

  * Plus a helper `toUnix` that simply converts `\` to `/` and consolidates duplicates.

**Useful note: these docs are actually auto generated from [specs](https://github.com/anodynos/upath/blob/master/source/spec/upath-spec.coffee), running on Linux.**

Notes:

 * `upath.sep` is set to `'/'` for seamless replacement (as of 1.0.3).

 * upath has no runtime dependencies, except built-in `path` (as of 1.0.4)
 
 * travis-ci tested in node versions 4 to 10      

## Why ?

Normal `path` doesn't convert paths to a unified format (ie `/`) before calculating paths (`normalize`, `join`), which can lead to numerous problems.
Also path joining, normalization etc on the two formats is not consistent, depending on where it runs. Running `path` on Windows yields different results than when it runs on Linux / Mac.

In general, if you code your paths logic while developing on Unix/Mac and it runs on Windows, you

The journey to the end of this Thesis has been long and challenging but I had the luck of sharing it with so many supporting and inspiring people. It is a pleasure to thank (some of) them who helped me, knowingly and unknowingly, in the successful completion of this project.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
First of all I would like to express my special thanks to my supervisor <strong>Pietro Corvaja</strong> who has introduced me to the beauty of Numbers and showed me the wonderful landscapes of Arithmetic; he has always provided insightful discussions about the research and has given me the freedom to pursue various projects providing essential help in these three years. I am also very grateful to all the other geometers in Udine, in particular <strong>Francesco Zucconi</strong> for many long and fruitful discussions and for always broaden my views, <strong>Pietro de Poi</strong> for formulas, coffees, and solutions of doubts and <strong>Paolo Cragnolini</strong> who introduced me to Geometry with the capital "G". I would also like to thank all the professors and administrative personnel of DIMI for these ten years from undergraduate to doctoralship.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
A special thank goes to <strong>Barbara Fantechi</strong> and <strong>Carlo Gasbarri</strong> who kindly accepted to be in my Ph.D. committee and with whom I had very fruitful conversations and discussions.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I had the fortune to share my office with friends more than colleagues: to <strong>Daniele</strong>, <strong>Edda</strong>, <strong>Emanuele</strong> and <strong>Luca</strong> go my gratitude for laughs, shared (and divided) food, happy moments, coffees and the (small amount of) math we made together in these years. At the same time my university life has been enriched with the presence of many good friends: <strong>Sara</strong> has been and still is the best friend I have ever met and T<strong>ommaso</strong> has always brought that lighthearted joy to my work days (although he tried to stop my Thesis with Minecraft!).
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
In these three years I have been so lucky to have the opportunity to spent almost 6 months at Brown University, in Providence (RI - USA). I am in debt with <strong>Dan Abramovich</strong> for making my stay in Providence possible, and for adopting me as “half-student” during those months: his support and his precious hints have played a big role in my mathematical development. At the same time I want to sincerely thank <strong>Joe Silverman</strong> for accepting to supervise me in that period and for the very interesting discussions. I would also like to thank all the people who helped me with the bureaucracy and with all my needs at the Math Department of Thayer Street, in particular <strong>Audrey</strong>, <strong>Doreen</strong> and <strong>Lori</strong>.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
In the same days I met many people who turned my stay in the US into a sunny, joyful period. Above all my office-mate, music-mate, AG-mate, DMB-mate and food-mate <strong>Kenny</strong> for uncountable discussions on math, music and food: you have been a real friend and I owe you so much for all the happiness of those months. I would like to thank <strong>Amalia</strong>, <strong>Hoang</strong>, <strong>Martin</strong>, <strong>Nhat</strong>, <strong>Sam</strong>, <strong>Asaf</strong> and all the students in the department who shared with me good moments in the basement and outside. I also thank all the members of the Brown Chorus for all the good music and vibes and for a wonderful Messiah together.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I also met a lot of people during this world-wide trip, who shared their math, their passions and their food with me: I am almost sure I am forgetting many of you, but I really thank you for the gifts you have left to me: <strong>Pranabesh</strong>, <strong>Marco</strong>, <strong>Francesco</strong>, <strong>Roger</strong>, <strong>Liana</strong>, <strong>Charles</strong>,..., and in particular <strong>Natalie</strong>.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    I want to thank, from the deep of my hearth, my whole Family: my mum <strong>Patrizia</strong>, who raised me almost by herself, providing unconditional love and care in any single moment of my life, and my brother <strong>Damiano</strong>, who shared with me all the good and bad moments, rejoicing for the former and supporting me in the latter. I love them both so much, and I would not have made it this far without them. To my enlarged family, my “as-brothers” <strong>Massimo</strong> and <strong>Federico</strong>, my aunt <strong>Pierina</strong>, <strong>Alice</strong>, <strong>Antonella</strong>, <strong>Mia</strong>, <strong>Silvia</strong> and the little <strong>Nicolò</strong>, thank you for being as you are. I want to thank also all my uncles, my aunts and my cousins too.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    Last but not least, I would like to thank all my music brothers and sisters: to those who have played with me and those who still share their music with me, to the crazy <strong>Confusion</strong> crew, to the unknown listener and the famous player, to the songs and the lyrics who moved me in any way, thank you because “without music, life would be a mistake”.

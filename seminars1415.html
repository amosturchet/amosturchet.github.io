            Erdös Multiplication Table theorem for generalised arithmetic progressions.<br>
            <h6><em>Abstract</em>: The well-known Multiplication Table theorem of Erdös says that the number of pairwise products of integers from 1 to N is considerably less than \(N^2\). In other words, it is not dense inside the interval \([1,\dots,N^2]\). Motivated by a problem in arithmetic combinatorics, we will extend the theorem to generalised arithmetic progressions (GAPs), namely that a product set of two GAPs cannot be dense inside another GAP of bounded rank. However, the current proof requires a technical condition that the sizes of the elements of the GAPs are polynomially bounded. In the rest of the talk we will discuss possible ways to remove this condition: by finding points of polynomially bounded height on a variety and, if time permits, the Cassels-Birch-Davenport theorem.</h6>

            The base change conductor.<br>
            <h6><em>Abstract</em>: Recently I considered the explicit computation of an invariant which appeared as a pole of a motivic zeta function of an abelian variety, the base change conductor of the abelian variety. Since, the same invariant has popped up in several places, including but not restricted to asymptotics of the \(L^2\) metric for degenerating families, the Faltings height, canonical bundle formulas and log-canonical tresholds. The common theme is semi-stable reduction.<br>
In this talk I will try to give the relationship to some of these topics, and talk about how to compute c for curves or their Jacobians. This is joint work and work in progress with Lars-Halvard Halle and Johannes Nicaise.</h6>

                  <h6><em>Abstract</em>: In this talk I will recall classical reciprocity laws on Riemann surfaces and explain how they translate into the language of connections on Deligne pairings. I will give a couple of applications. One explains a construction of Hitchin on hyperkähler varieties of lambda-connections, the other explains a result of Fay on holomorphic extensions of analytic torsion on spaces of characters of the fundamental group of a Riemann surface.

                  Univalent foundation of mathematics.<br>
                  <h6><em>Abstract</em>: This talk will be a general introduction to Voevodsky's program of providing a foundation of mathematics based on type theory instead of set theory. One main insight is that dependent type theory provides a good system of notations for representing directly the notion of (weak) omega-groupoid/homotopy types. This point of view suggests a stratification of types in propositions, sets, groupoids,... Type theory appears in this way to be a generalization of set theory. It also suggests the axiom of univalence, which is a strong form of the axiom of extensionality.</h6>

                Stability of restrictions of the cotangent bundle of hermitian symmetric spaces.<br>
                <h6><em>Abstract</em>: (Joint work with Indranil Biswas and Pierre-Emmanuel Chaput) 
We show that the restriction of the cotangent bundle of a hermitian symmetric space to a non linear complete intersection of dimension at least 3 is stable. We also discuss some special cases of restriction to lower dimension complete intersection. We will also show that the restriction to the closed orbit of the cotangent bundle of a projective representation space for a semi-simple complex Lie group is semi-stable.</h6>

                The range of the commuting probability function on finite groups.<br>
                <h6><em>Abstract</em>: For a finite group \(G\), one defines \(Pr(G)\) to be the fraction of ordered pairs of group elements that commute. The function \(Pr\), called the commuting probability function, maps the collection of all finite groups to a subset \(S\) of the rationals inside \([0,1]\). The subject of the talk is the structure of this set \(S\). The first indication that there might be something interesting to say in this regard is the fact, which is an easy exercise to verify, that \(S\) contains no elements in the open interval \((5/8, 1)\). In his PhD thesis in 1969, and again in the AMM in 1977, Keith Joseph made three bold conjectures about the set \(S\), which I'll term J1, J2 and J3. Though the intervening years have seen the publication of many papers on the commuting probability function, almost none paid any direct attention to Joseph's "big picture" questions, a situation which can perhaps be partly explained by the fact that Joseph himself left academia in the 1970s. In 2013, I wrote a paper making some progress on J1 and J2 and giving the vague outlines of a "roadmap" to a full resolution of them. Late last year, Sean Eberhard succeeded in proving both conjectures in full. I will present Joseph's conjectures and Eberhard's work. Note that J3 remains wide open.</h6>

              <span >Uniformity results in Diophantine Geometry</span><br>
              <h6><em>Abstract</em>: In 1997 Caporaso, Harris and Mazur proved that Lang Conjecture (i.e. rational points in general type varieties are not Zariski dense) implies that the number of rational point in curves of genus >1 are not only finite (Falting’s Theorem) but uniform; in particular their number depends only on the genus and on the base field. This result has been extended to surfaces by Hassett. The key point is a “fibered power theorem” which has been proved to hold in arbitrary dimension by Abramovich. Analogous problems have been treated for (stably) integral points for elliptic curves and principally polarised abelian varieties. In my talk I will give an introduction to this subject deepening the interplay of geometry and arithmetic, as well as introducing a work in progress project, joint with Kenneth Ascher, aiming to extend the results for integral points for all log general type surfaces. </h6>

              <h6><em>Abstract</em>: The fibered power theorems (FPTs) as in the papers of Caporaso-Harris-Mazur, Hassett, and Abramovich, state that a high fibered power of a family of varieties of general type dominates a variety of general type. They are typically proven in a series of three steps: reduction via moduli, a positivity result, and control on the singularities. I plan to discuss methods for controlling the singularities. At the end, we will discuss possible extensions of FPTs to the case of open varieties. </h6>

The procedure assumes that the Hasse-Weil L-function of the variety satisfies its conjectured functional equation, but there is no assumption of an associated automorphic object or Galois representation. As an example we used the method to find the Hasse-Weil L-functions of all hyperelliptic curves of conductor less than 500.</h6>

              <h6><em>Abstract</em>: The aim of this talk is to motivate the definition of overconvergent modular forms, both from a technical and more philosophical perspective. We will start by reviewing the complex analytic definition of a modular form and then sketch the modifications needed for the most accessible modern definition of overconvergent modular forms, due to Pilloni. Along the way we will try to motivate why one would want to consider such objects. If there is time the end I will sketch a new definition, appearing in work in progress with Przemsylaw Chojecki and David Hansen, which is very close in spirit to the traditional complex analytic definition of a modular form.</h6>

We describe examples using deformations of isolated non normal surface singularities.</h6>
